    <h2>Some facts about our beautiful City of Denver, Colorado</h2>
    <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/panorama-of-denver-skyline-at-twilight-picture-id1130838143?k=6&m=1130838143&s=612x612&w=0&h=HSyfbaWPOt6Lwh-4KRDAMPhGibpn50eB6cowmJ9SSsE="

        Denver boasts the 10th largest downtown in America and one of the most exciting and walkable. Within a mile
        radius, downtown Denver has three major sports stadiums, the nation's second-largest performing arts center,
        three colleges, an assortment of art and history museums, a mint that produces 10 billion coins a year, a
        river offering whitewater rafting, more than 11,000 hotel rooms, a downtown theme and water park, downtown
        aquarium and hundreds of chef-driven restaurants.
    </p>
    <p>Denver has more than 200 parks within the city and 20,000 acres of parks in the nearby mountains, including
        spectacular Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre. The city has its own buffalo herd and every year plants more than
        200,000 flowers in 26 formal flower gardens. Other mountain parks include Echo Lake, at the base of the
        Mount Evans highway – the highest road in North America – and Buffalo Bill's Grave on top of Lookout
        Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>From global warming and renewable energy to environmental cleanup, Denver is emerging as a model for
        sustainable cities. The Colorado Convention Center is green through and through, including a rare LEED Gold
        certification for existing buildings and the Blue Bear Farm that grows more than 5,000 pounds of fresh
        produce annually! Denver International Airport is dedicated to sustainable practices, including a Community
        Stewardship philosophy that includes energy and environmental management, green buildings and noise
        abatement. The Denver Zoo's Toyota Elephant Passage uses a biomass gasification system, which can turn human
        trash and animal waste into energy to power the exhibit. Plus, many of Denver’s famous craft breweries are
        committed to recycling programs and responsible water usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Located east of a major mountain range, Denver has a mild, dry and sunny climate with more annual hours of
        sun than San Diego or Miami Beach. In winter, Denver is dryer than Phoenix with an average daily high of 45
        degrees (7 degrees Celsius) in February. Golf courses remain open all year and have been played as many as
        30 days in January.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you're enjoying a night out on the town at one of Larimer Square's independently owned fine dining
        spots or digging into the offerings from one of the city's many gourmet food halls, you can count on fresh,
        local ingredients. The city's beer world is booming, too, with new craft breweries opening up every month,
        along with several distilleries and wineries, too!
