            Easy Access & Walkability
            Getting to Denver is easy, thanks to the efficient Denver International Airport (DEN), one of the largest
            connecting airports in the world. From there, it’s a short, effortless trip on the airport train to Denver
            Union Station in the heart of downtown. Arriving at Union Station, visitors are greeted with an opulent and
            fully restored 1914 Beaux-Arts train station, home to swanky bars, restaurants, shops and a boutique hotel.
            In wintertime, skiers and snowboarders can take the Winter Park Express ski train from the station to the
            mountains for a unique ski-in, ski-out experience (runs seasonally). From Union Station, access downtown on
            foot, by bike, or on the free 16th Street Mall shuttle.
        </p>
        <p class="one">Denver has more than 200 parks.
            Within the city and 20,000 acres of parks in the nearby mountains, including
            spectacular Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre. The city has its own buffalo herd and every year plants more than
            200,000 flowers in 26 formal flower gardens. Other mountain parks include Echo Lake, at the base of the
            Mount Evans highway – the highest road in North America – and Buffalo Bill's Grave on top of Lookout
            Mountain.

        <p class="one">A Foodie Paradise
            Denver is also a hub for chef-owned restaurants and was featured in the fifteenth season of Bravo's hit TV
            show "Top Chef." Stroll among the Victorian buildings and boutique shops of Larimer Square and take your
            pick of culinary talent, then indulge yourself with the many offerings from locally sourced products. Denver
            is at the forefront of the food hall revolution, including Avanti F&B, where seven rotating casual dining
            concepts share space with two craft bars and a patio with spectacular views of downtown; The Source, an
            artisan market housed in a former ironworks foundry; Zeppelin Station, with street food vendors, designer
            goods and apparel, and two cocktail bars; Denver Milk Market, featuring 16 culinary concepts run by
            acclaimed chef Frank Bonanno; and Central Market, where visitors will find nearly a dozen providers serving
            everything from wood-fired pizza and charcuterie to fresh-baked breads and gourmet chocolates.
        </p>
        <p class="one">
            Located east of a major mountain range, Denver has a mild, dry and sunny climate with more annual hours of
            sun than San Diego or Miami Beach. In winter, Denver is dryer than Phoenix with an average daily high of 45
            degrees (7 degrees Celsius) in February. Golf courses remain open all year and have been played as many as
            30 days in January.

            Whether you're enjoying a night out on the town at one of Larimer Square's independently owned fine dining
            spots or digging into the offerings from one of the city's many gourmet food halls, you can count on fresh,
            local ingredients. The city's beer world is booming, too, with new craft breweries opening up every month,
            along with several distilleries and wineries, too!
