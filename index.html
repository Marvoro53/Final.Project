    <p class="two"> Denver, Colorado — The Mile High City — is where urban sophistication meets outdoor adventure.
        Denver is an
        outdoor city known for its world-class cultural attractions, thriving craft breweries, chef-driven dining and
        red-hot music scene, all within easy reach of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

        <h2>Some facts about our beautiful City of Denver, Colorado</h2>

        <h2 class="one">Easy Access & Walkability</h2>
        <p>
            Getting to Denver is easy, thanks to the efficient Denver International Airport (DEN), one of the largest
            connecting airports in the world. From there, it’s a short, effortless trip on the airport train to Denver
            Union Station in the heart of downtown. Arriving at Union Station, visitors are greeted with an opulent and
            fully restored 1914 Beaux-Arts train station, home to swanky bars, restaurants, shops and a boutique hotel.
            In wintertime, skiers and snowboarders can take the Winter Park Express ski train from the station to the
            mountains for a unique ski-in, ski-out experience (runs seasonally). From Union Station, access downtown on
            foot, by bike, or on the free 16th Street Mall shuttle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="one">Vibrant Neighborhoods</h2>
        <p>
            Denver has more than 200 parks within the city and 20,000 acres of parks in the nearby mountains, including
            spectacular Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre. The city has its own buffalo herd and every year plants more than
            200,000 flowers in 26 formal flower gardens. Other mountain parks include Echo Lake, at the base of the
            Mount Evans highway – the highest road in North America – and Buffalo Bill's Grave on top of Lookout
            Mountain.
            <br>
            If you really want to explore Denver, delve into its diverse neighborhoods. The River North Art District
            (RiNo) is “where art is made,” riding a wave of urban revival with art galleries, craft breweries,
            restaurants and eye-popping street art on nearly every corner. Cherry Creek, just 5 minutes from downtown,
            is Denver's premier shopping neighborhood with everything from independently owned boutiques on 16 charming
            blocks in Cherry Creek North to popular upscale brands in Cherry Creek Shopping Center and the nearby Denver
            Botanic Gardens. Close to downtown is the trendy Highlands neighborhood with Victorian-era homes, hip
            restaurants, lush gardens, art galleries and a famous ice cream shop in a giant milk can. The Art District
            on Santa Fe is a haven for art lovers with more than 30 art galleries and colorful murals, highlighting the
            neighborhood’s Hispanic roots. Uptown has a long stretch of cafés, bistros and pubs with outdoor patios near
            the city’s largest greenspace, City Park, which also houses the Denver Zoo and Denver Museum of Nature &
            Science. And in Five Points, the music of jazz legends transcends local clubs. Now it’s a fusion of old and
            new with coffeehouses, breweries, museums and beloved barbecue institutions.
        </p>
        <h2 class="one">A Foodie Paradise</h2>
        <p>
            Denver is also a hub for chef-owned restaurants and was featured in the fifteenth season of Bravo's hit TV
            show "Top Chef." Stroll among the Victorian buildings and boutique shops of Larimer Square and take your
            pick of culinary talent, then indulge yourself with the many offerings from locally sourced products. Denver
            is at the forefront of the food hall revolution, including Avanti F&B, where seven rotating casual dining
            concepts share space with two craft bars and a patio with spectacular views of downtown; The Source, an
            artisan market housed in a former ironworks foundry; Zeppelin Station, with street food vendors, designer
            goods and apparel, and two cocktail bars; Denver Milk Market, featuring 16 culinary concepts run by
            acclaimed chef Frank Bonanno; and Central Market, where visitors will find nearly a dozen providers serving
            everything from wood-fired pizza and charcuterie to fresh-baked breads and gourmet chocolates.

            Denver is also known for something other than its high altitude: beer. With more than 100 breweries and tap
            rooms in the metro area, there is endless variety from pale ales, one-off firkins and daring ingredients,
            created by a community of passionate artisans crafting some of the most adventurous beers in the country.
            The Denver Beer Trail, a collection of more than 30 of Denver’s top beers, can be your guide to this hoppy
            heaven.

        <h2 class="one">The Sporting Life</h2>
        <p>
            Home to the three-time Super Bowl-winning Denver Broncos, Denver is as sports-crazy as you think. Three
            downtown stadiums for football (Broncos), baseball (Colorado Rockies), basketball (Denver Nuggets) and
            hockey (Colorado Avalanche) means you can catch a game and then head out on the town with ease. And of
            course, if you come looking for outdoor recreation, you won’t be disappointed. The city offers miles upon
            miles of paved off-road trails that connect to a vast array of dirt trails and mountain-bike adventures.
            Indoor and outdoor adventure parks showcase extreme sports — from the Downtown Denver Skatepark to Ruby Hill
            Mountain Bike Park. The nearby Rocky Mountains boast hiking excursions, rafting, world-class ski slopes and
            wildlife. Rocky Mountain National Park, one of the top outdoor destinations in the world, is just a
            90-minute drive from downtown.
